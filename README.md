# Prediction of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Using Optimized Machine Learning Classifiers
This repository contains a dataset on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and machine learning models used to classify whether a patient has PCOS based on various health metrics.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains health-related attributes of patients, including:

- **PCOS Status: Whether the patient has Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (Y/N).**
- **Age: Patient's age in years.**
- **Weight: Weight in kilograms.**
- **Height: Height in centimeters.**
- **BMI: Body Mass Index.**
- **Blood Group: Encoded values (A+, A-, B+, B-, O+, O-, AB+, AB-).**
- **Pulse Rate: Heart rate in beats per minute.**
- **Respiration Rate: Breaths per minute.**
- **Hormonal Levels: Beta-HCG, FSH, LH, AMH, etc.**
- **Other Attributes: Menstrual cycle details, pregnancy status, blood pressure, follicle counts, and various health conditions (e.g., hair growth, skin darkening).**
  
## Machine Learning Models Used
The following models were applied to classify the PCOS status:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Random Forest**
- **K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **XGBoost**
  
These models help predict the likelihood of PCOS by analyzing the various factors provided in the dataset.

## Instructions
To run the models and analyze the dataset, ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. Then, load the notebook and dataset to explore the findings.

## Did You Know?
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) affects up to 10% of women of reproductive age. Early diagnosis and management can significantly improve long-term health outcomes!
